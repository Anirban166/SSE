> Based on my reading of Ross Anderson's 'Security Engineering':

Laying the groundwork for SE is what the first chapter intends to institute, and I would say that it did a fairly good job of getting across the abstract or an overview of the field to me. I realize that this particular field of study focuses on computers and more specifically software and network security, but it inevitably depends on or interfaces with other forms of security (physical, for e.g.) as well.

Prior to reading about the established framework, I thought that selecting one or a mix of different mechanisms based on their assurance level in order to achieve the end goal or 'policy' could be sufficient to summarize the working of a security system in terms of the mentioned framework components. Yes, I never thought about *incentive*, as I previously considered that to be a separate point. After reading about the perspectives of the decision makers (may it be policy weavers or system breachers), the inclusion of that component started to make sense, and as to why it was interconnected with the others.

I liked the examples because they were simple enough for me to wrap in my head the possible scenarios in play. I feel they demonstrated a good form of 'incentive' for the attacker (financial profit from bank accounts, an advantage in warfare from military data breach and jamming, leveraging injury/disease/impairment/disability-based information from medical health records for very specific potential harm against individual patients, etc.), showcased realistic situations, and included a reasonable discussion on the operation and potential risks of such systems.

If I were to name one element from the reading that I found to be particularly insightful, it would be insider threats. The fact that employees themselves pose a high risk for the system that they deal with is really concerning. The point that I noted is that employees too in a cynical sense, are perfectly suitable to be humans that deviate from protocols for personal interests and that a certain degree of trust although exists, is not sufficient to determine a secure modus operandi from their ends.

Frankly speaking, I am not surprised that iniquitous behaviour could still arise from individuals at positions that generally either reflect trust (like a bank employee) or have severe consequences for going against expected behaviour for the sake of personal interests. Monitoring of work-related activity in that sense seems to be essential. This reminds me of the example in the summary (which I found to be interesting), where the definition of 'security' tends to be a polar opposite between the two entities (a corporation and the employees under it were the entities) - one concerning possible employee data breaches, and the other concerning 'privacy' of the employees, both in terms of monitoring such activity. This last part also gave me a concrete example to supplement or fortify my understanding that the terminology associated with security engineering is not static and changes with the context that we are dealing with.
